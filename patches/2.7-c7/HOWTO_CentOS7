1. grab the .src.rpm from http://vault.centos.org/7.2.1511/os/Source/SPackages/python-2.7.5-34.el7.src.rpm
2. install it:  rpm -ivh python-2.7.5-34.el7.src.rpm 
   - you can do this as unprivileged user (actually it is the recommended way)
   - will install files under $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES and $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS
3. cp pep445.patch under $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES:
   3.a: cd $HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES
   3.b: wget -v https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mojaves/pytracemalloc/master/patches/2.7-c7/pep445.patch -O 04000-pep445.patch
4. apply patch to spec file:
   4.a: cd $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS
   4.b: wget -v https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mojaves/pytracemalloc/master/patches/2.7-c7/python-pep445-spec.patch
   4.c: patch -p0 < python-pep445-spec.patch
5. recompile the python package
   4.a: cd $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS
   4.b: rpmbuild -ba python.spec
   - the rebuild process can take quite some time
   - you'll need plenty of development packages installed, rpmbuild will tell you
6. Find your new RPMS under $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/*
   - those RPMs replace the ones shipped by default by CentOS 7.
   - you may need to rebuild them, or reinstall them, if the system updates the python packages.
   - the PEP445 patch should be ABI compatible with regular CentOS7's python, but this was not carefully
     reviewed. Should you experience weird behaviours, please consider recompiling non-pure python
     packages already installed (e.g. libvirt-python)
